## Hi there 👋

I’m Vukosi, a senior full-stack .NET developer based in South Africa.

I design and build systems that actually get used — enterprise apps, APIs, and mobile tools.
If an idea feels worthwhile (or fun), there’s a good chance I’ll prototype it, refine it, and ship it.

## What I work on

* Retirement fund admin systems (claims, employer management, investment data)
* Modernizing legacy .NET & AngularJS apps
* Flutter apps (TikTok/YouTube shorts tools, games, utilities)
* Clean, scalable APIs and multi-step workflows

## My main tech stack

* **Backend:** C#, .NET 8, MSSQL
* **Frontend:** React, Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript
* **Mobile:** Flutter (GoRouter + Riverpod)
* **Tools:** Azure DevOps, Git, Jira, Postman

## Fun facts

* Gym and anime are core personality traits
* I build a *lot* of side projects
* Currently grinding Clash Royale to hit ultimate champion (again)
